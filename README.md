### Hi there! I'm
# Willow Marmon
## An IT Professional and a hobbiest developer

### About me
I'm a problem solver at heart. The code I write always serves a purpose, and language or system choices exist to fill that need. As such I write in a variety of languages, but I'm strongest in: Java, Python, Rust, and C.

I have some history in journalism, and as such am a proponent of encryption. You never know when a piece of information might be used against you by a stalker, a government, or a corperation. Encryption should be standard wherever possible, and there should be readily available methods of strong encryption. In that vein, you can find my public PGP key [here](https://pgp.willowmarmon.com/willow).

### Other interests
Outside of tech, I enjoy writing, book binding, knitting, and some very basic sewing. I also enjoy music, and am known as that girl who always has music in her ear.
